# What issues have we faced and how we resolved them

One of our primary hurdles was mastering version control with GitHub. Initially, tasks like pulling, pushing, and merging our local branches with the remote ones proved to be challenging. However, with time and practice, we got the hang of it, streamlining our collaborative efforts and ensuring smooth project progression.
