# What I have learned

[Tell more about what you have learned while building this project]

**Example:**

While I was building {YOUR_PROJECT_NAME} I have learned the fundamentals of React and Redux. I learned what is the difference between React Context API and Redux, and what works best for my current application. I have used Reat hooks like useEffect, useState. It was my first project using TypeScript and I have learned a lot about TypeScript type definitions and fundamentals.

# What issues have we faced and how we resolved them

**Example:**

When I tried to connect to the third-party API, I was not sure how to use fetch and what is the difference between async/await, what are Promises and how to use them. After some Googling I found out the MDN documentation about async/await and tried to use it in practice - it worked!
